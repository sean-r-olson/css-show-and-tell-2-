My CSS feature I chose is 'position: sticky;'. The 'position' property, when applied to a class, ID, etc., is to determine how that selected section of your page is displayed relative to other sections/the page as a whole while scrolling through a webpage. The 'sticky' position keeps the selected section "stuck" in a certain positon on the page while scrolling.
